# Lab_Wellplate-compound-list-parser
384 wellplate drug screen project

Reads a TSV of compounds as administered to a 384 wellplate. Saves two generated CSVs: a list of unique compounds given an integer #, and a 'map' of those #'s to individual wells. These CSVs ae ready by MATLAB GUI scripts for handling images of c.elegans in the wells and measurements of Calcium fluorescence.
